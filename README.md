This project involves subnetting the 192.168.5.0/24 network using Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) to provide the necessary IP addressing for multiple LANs. Additionally, static routes will be configured on the routers so that all PCs within the network can communicate.

Key Objectives:
Subnet the 192.168.5.0/24 network
Use VLSM to create subnets that meet the host requirements for each LAN and the point-to-point connection between the two routers.

LAN 1: 45 hosts
LAN 2: 64 hosts
LAN 3: 14 hosts
LAN 4: 9 hosts
Point-to-point link between R1 and R2
Assign IP addresses

Assign the first usable IP address to each PC in the respective LANs.
Assign the last usable IP address to the router interface in each LAN.
Configure static routes
Configure static routes on R1 and R2 to ensure that all devices in the network can communicate. The routes must account for the network topology and ensure full connectivity between PCs across LANs.
